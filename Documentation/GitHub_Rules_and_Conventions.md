### Branches

We intend to follow git flow for our branching strategy, with two core branches:
- main
	- Default branch, this is where the stable releases will be.
- dev
	- Developing branch, this is where everything comes together.

### Which branch do I push to?


### How does my code merge into the core branches?


### Branch naming conventions

Every branch name starts with a branch category, followed by a descriptive name.
Possible Branch Categories:
- feature/
- fix/
- setup/
- docs/

The specific branch names will be all lower case, and hyphen separated.
For example: 
- feature/view-dashboard
- fix/grid-visualisation-bug
